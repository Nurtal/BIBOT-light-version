Acute kidney injury (AKI), characterized by abrupt deterioration of renal function, is a common clinical event among hospitalized patients and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. AKI is defined in three stages with stage-3 being the most severe phase which is irreversible. It is important to effectively discover the true risk factors in order to identify high-risk AKI patients and allow better targeting of tailored interventions. However, Stage-3 AKI patients are very rare (only 0.2% of AKI patients) with a large scale of features available in EHR (1917 potential risk features), yielding a scenario unfeasible for any correlation-based feature selection or modeling method. This study aims to discover the key factors and improve the detection of Stage-3 AKI.
