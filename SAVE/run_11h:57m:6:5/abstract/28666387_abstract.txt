In the early days of computation, slow processor speeds limited the amount of data that could be generated and used for scientific purposes. In the age of big data, the limiting factor usually is the method with which large amounts of data are analyzed and useful information is extracted. A typical example from chemistry are high-level ab initio calculations for small systems, which have nowadays become feasible even if energies at many different geometries are required. Molecular dynamics simulations often require several thousand distinct trajectories to be run. Under such circumstances suitable analytical representations of potential energy surfaces (PESs) based on ab initio calculations are required to propagate the dynamics at an acceptable cost. In this work we introduce a toolkit which allows the automatic construction of multidimensional PESs from gridded ab initio data based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory. The resulting representations require no tuning of parameters and allow energy and force evaluations at ab initio quality at the same cost as empirical force fields. Although the toolkit is primarily intended for constructing multidimensional potential energy surfaces for molecular systems, it can also be used for general machine learning purposes. The software is published under the MIT license and can be downloaded, modified, and used in other projects for free.
