Healthcare providers generate a huge amount of biomedical data stored in either legacy system (paper-based) format or electronic medical records (EMR) around the world, which are collectively referred to as big biomedical data (BBD). To realize the promise of BBD for clinical use and research, it is an essential step to extract key data elements from unstructured medical records into patient-centered electronic health records with computable data elements. Our objective is to introduce a novel solution, known as a double-reading/entry system (DRESS), for extracting clinical data from unstructured medical records (MR) and creating a semi-structured electronic health record database, as well as to demonstrate its reproducibility empirically.
