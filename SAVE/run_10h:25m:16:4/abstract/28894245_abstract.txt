Complicated structures consisting of multi-layers with a multi-modal array of device components, i.e., so-called patterned multi-layers, and their corresponding circuit designs for signal readout and addressing are used to achieve a macroscale electronic skin (e-skin). In contrast to this common approach, we realized an extremely simple macroscale e-skin only by employing a single-layered piezoresistive MWCNT-PDMS composite film with neither nano-, micro-, nor macro-patterns. It is the deep machine learning that made it possible to let such a simple bulky material play the role of a smart sensory device. A deep neural network (DNN) enabled us to process electrical resistance change induced by applied pressure and thereby to instantaneously evaluate the pressure level and the exact position under pressure. The great potential of this revolutionary concept for the attainment of pressure-distribution sensing on a macroscale area could expand its use to not only e-skin applications but to other high-end applications such as touch panels, portable flexible keyboard, sign language interpreting globes, safety diagnosis of social infrastructures, and the diagnosis of motility and peristalsis disorders in the gastrointestinal tract.
