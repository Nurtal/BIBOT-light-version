A deep machine-learning technique based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced. It has been used for the classification of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in terms of crystal system, extinction group and space group. About 150â€…000 powder XRD patterns were collected and used as input for the CNN with no handcrafted engineering involved, and thereby an appropriate CNN architecture was obtained that allowed determination of the crystal system, extinction group and space group. In sharp contrast with the traditional use of powder XRD pattern analysis, the CNN never treats powder XRD patterns as a deconvoluted and discrete peak position or as intensity data, but instead the XRD patterns are regarded as nothing but a pattern similar to a picture. The CNN interprets features that humans cannot recognize in a powder XRD pattern. As a result, accuracy levels of 81.14, 83.83 and 94.99% were achieved for the space-group, extinction-group and crystal-system classifications, respectively. The well trained CNN was then used for symmetry identification of unknown novel inorganic compounds.
