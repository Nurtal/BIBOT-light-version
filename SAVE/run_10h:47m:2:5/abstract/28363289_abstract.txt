Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is of serious concern, causing over 30% of all adverse drug reactions and resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Early discovery of adverse DDI is critical to prevent patient harm. Spontaneous reporting systems have been a major resource for drug safety surveillance that routinely collects adverse event reports from patients and healthcare professionals. In this study, we present a novel approach to discover DDIs from the Food and Drug Administration's adverse event reporting system.
