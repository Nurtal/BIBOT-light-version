Large structured databases of pathology findings are valuable in deriving new clinical insights. However, they are labor intensive to create and generally require manual annotation. There has been some work in the bioinformatics community to support automating this work via machine learning in English. Our contribution is to provide an automated approach to construct such structured databases in Chinese, and to set the stage for extraction from other languages.
