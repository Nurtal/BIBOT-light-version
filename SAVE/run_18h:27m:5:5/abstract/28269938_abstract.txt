patient cohort retrieval system operating on a vast archive of EEG data. In this paper, we present a multi-modal EEG patient cohort retrieval system called MERCuRY which leverages the heterogeneous nature of EEG data by processing both the clinical narratives from EEG reports as well as the raw electrode potentials derived from the recorded EEG signal data. At the core of MERCuRY is a novel multimodal clinical indexing scheme which relies on EEG data representations obtained through deep learning. The index is used by two clinical relevance models that we have generated for identifying patient cohorts satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria expressed in natural language queries. Evaluations of the MERCuRY system measured the relevance of the patient cohorts, obtaining MAP scores of 69.87% and a NDCG of 83.21%.
