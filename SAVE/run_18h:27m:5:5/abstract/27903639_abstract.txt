NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development of a biological marker for pain continues to gain traction in literature. Our findings show that high- and low-pain perception in human subjects can be classified with 89% accuracy using high-density EEG data from prefrontal cortex and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Our approach represents a novel neurophysiological paradigm that advances the literature on biological markers for pain.
