Wearable biosensors, such as those embedded in smart phones, can provide data to assess neuro-motor control in mobile settings, at homes, schools, workplaces and clinics. However, because most machine learning algorithms currently used to analyze such data require several steps that depend on human heuristics, the analyses become computationally expensive and rather subjective. Further, there is no standardized scale or set of tasks amenable to take advantage of such technology in ways that permit broad dissemination and reproducibility of results. Indeed, there is a critical need for fully objective automated analytical methods that easily handle the deluge of data these sensors output, while providing standardized scales amenable to apply across large sections of the population, to help promote personalized-mobile medicine. Here we use an open-access data set from Kaggle.com to illustrate the use of a new statistical platform and standardized data types applied to smart phone accelerometer and gyroscope data from 30 participants, performing six different activities. We report full distinction without confusion of the activities from the Kaggle set using a single parameter (linear acceleration or angular speed). We further extend the use of our platform to characterize data from commercially available smart shoes, using gait patterns within a set of experiments that probe nervous systems functioning and levels of motor control.
