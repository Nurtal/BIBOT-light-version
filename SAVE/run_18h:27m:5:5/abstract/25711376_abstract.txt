We report in this article central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) caused by hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) in a young patient with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SjS). A 32-year-old female was referred to our hospital from a local ophthalmologist. Fundoscopic examination and fluorescein angiogram revealed she had a serous retinal detachment in the right eye, together with CRVO (nonischemic type) in both eyes. Systemic examinations revealed hyperglobulinemia, increased blood viscosity, increased antinuclear antibody, increased rheumatoid arthritis particle aggregation, and increased anti-SS-A antibody. Together with a decreased salivary gland secretory function, she was eventually diagnosed as suffering from SjS. Moreover, a large cystic mass was found in the anterior mediastinum on the chest X-ray. Fine needle biopsy soon revealed she had MALT lymphoma. After eight courses of the administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP), most laboratory values were normalized, including blood viscosity. Cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum decreased, and the conditions of CRVO in both eyes had much improved. Decreased best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the right eye was fully restored by sixth month. Not only MALT lymphoma, but also SjS can cause secondary hyperglobulinemia. Indeed, immunoelectrophoresis-serum test showed a polyclonal pattern of hyperglobulinemia. Therefore, SjS was thought to be the primary reason of hyperglobulinemia in this patient, which induced HVS, eventually causing CRVO. R-CVP therapy was effective for not only MALT lymphoma but also SjS accompanied with HVS. Consequently, R-CVP therapy led to the improvement of CRVO.
