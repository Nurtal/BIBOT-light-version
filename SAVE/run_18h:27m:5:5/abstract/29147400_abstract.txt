Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the indispensible part of hormone-responsive breast cancer treatment. A potential relation between autoimmunity and AIs has been described before. Herein, we report a case of Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) and polyneuropathy which developed during treatment with anastrozole. A 70 years old female patient having a history of breast cancer was referred to our clinic with numbness in both legs for 1 year. She was receiving anastrazole since 2006. She was having sicca symptoms for 3 years. After laboratory evaluation, salivary gland biopsy and electroneuromyography, the patient was evaluated as SjS and polyneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment (400 mg/kg/day, 5 days, 6 months) was initiated. A potential pathogenic linkage between AI therapy and autoimmunity is mentioned. Only few cases of rheumatoid arthritis and SjS related with AIs have been reported. But, our case is the first in the literature having definite SjS and neuropathy in this setting.
