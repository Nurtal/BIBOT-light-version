The first challenge in the 2014 competition launched by the Teach-Discover-Treat (TDT) initiative asked for the development of a tutorial for ligand-based virtual screening, based on data from a primary phenotypic high-throughput screen (HTS) against malaria. The resulting Workflows were applied to select compounds from a commercial database, and a subset of those were purchased and tested experimentally for anti-malaria activity. Here, we present the two most successful Workflows, both using machine-learning approaches, and report the results for the 114 compounds tested in the follow-up screen. Excluding the two known anti-malarials quinidine and amodiaquine and 31 compounds already present in the primary HTS, a high hit rate of 57% was found.
