The imaging diagnosis and prognostication of different degrees of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is very important for early care and clinical treatment. Especially, the exact recognition of mild TBI is the bottleneck for current label-free imaging technologies in neurosurgery. Here, we report an automatic evaluation method for TBI recognition with terahertz (THz) continuous-wave (CW) transmission imaging based on machine learning (ML). We propose a new feature extraction method for biological THz images combined with the transmittance distribution features in spatial domain and statistical distribution features in normalized gray histogram. Based on the extracted feature database, ML algorithms are performed for the classification of different degrees of TBI by feature selection and parameter optimization. The highest classification accuracy is up to 87.5%. The area under the curve (AUC) scores of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve are all higher than 0.9, which shows this evaluation method has a good generalization ability. Furthermore, the excellent performance of the proposed system in the recognition of mild TBI is analyzed by different methodological parameters and diagnostic criteria. The system can be extensible to various diseases and will be a powerful tool in automatic biomedical diagnostics.
