Conclusions: Secondary use of patient data (apart from personal health care record data) can be expressed according to many ways. Requirements to allow this secondary use have to be harmonized between countries, and social media platforms can be efficiently used to explore and create knowledge on patient experience with health problems or activities. Machine learning algorithms can explore those massive amounts of data to support health care professionals, and institutions provide more accurate knowledge about use and usage, behaviour, sentiment, or satisfaction about health care delivery.
