Kidney cancer is of prominent concern in modern medicine. Predicting patient survival is critical to patient awareness and developing a proper treatment regimens. Previous prediction models built upon molecular feature analysis are limited to just gene expression data. In this study we investigate the difference in predicting five year survival between unimodal and multimodal analysis of RNA-seq data from gene, exon, junction, and isoform modalities. Our preliminary findings report higher predictive accuracy-as measured by area under the ROC curve (AUC)-for multimodal learning when compared to unimodal learning with both support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods. The results of this study justify further research on the use of multimodal RNA-seq data to predict survival for other cancer types using a larger sample size and additional machine learning methods.
