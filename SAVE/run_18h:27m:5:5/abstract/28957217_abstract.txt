Polarization-based filtering in fiber lasers is well-known to enable spectral tunability and a wide range of dynamical operating states. This effect is rarely exploited in practical systems, however, because optimization of cavity parameters is nontrivial and evolves due to environmental sensitivity. Here, we report a genetic algorithm-based approach, utilizing electronic control of the cavity transfer function, to autonomously achieve broad wavelength tuning and the generation of Q-switched pulses with variable repetition rate and duration. The practicalities and limitations of simultaneous spectral and temporal self-tuning from a simple fiber laser are discussed, paving the way to on-demand laser properties through algorithmic control and machine learning schemes.
