Health-care initiatives are pushing the development and utilization of clinical data for medical discovery and translational research studies. Machine learning tools implemented for Big Data have been applied to detect patterns in complex diseases. This study focuses on hypertension and examines phenotype data across a major clinical study called Minority Health Genomics and Translational Research Repository Database composed of self-reported African American (AA) participants combined with related cohorts. Prior genome-wide association studies for hypertension in AAs presumed that an increase of disease burden in susceptible populations is due to rare variants. But genomic analysis of hypertension, even those designed to focus on rare variants, has yielded marginal genome-wide results over many studies. Machine learning and other nonparametric statistical methods have recently been shown to uncover relationships in complex phenotypes, genotypes, and clinical data. We trained neural networks with phenotype data for missing-data imputation to increase the usable size of a clinical data set. Validity was established by showing performance effects using the expanded data set for the association of phenotype variables with case/control status of patients. Data mining classification tools were used to generate association rules.
