The gut-brain axis communicates the brain with the gut microbiota, a bidirectional conduit that has received increasing attention in recent years thanks to its emerging role in brain development and function. Alterations in microbiota composition have been associated to neurological and psychiatric disorders, and several studies suggest that the immune system plays a fundamental role in the gut-brain interaction. Recent advances in brain imaging and in microbiome sequencing have generated a large amount of information, yet the data from both these sources need to be combined efficiently to extract biological meaning, and any diagnostic and/or prognostic benefit from these tools. In addition, the causal nature of the gut-brain interaction remains to be fully established, and preclinical findings translated to humans. In this "Perspective" article, we discuss recent efforts to combine data on the gut microbiota with the features that can be obtained from the conversion of brain images into mineable data. The subsequent analysis of these data for diagnostic and prognostic purposes is an approach we call radiomicrobiomics and it holds tremendous potential to enhance our understanding of this fascinating connection.
