Systemic sclerosis (SSc, or scleroderma) is a rheumatic disease with distinct features that encompass autoimmunity, vascular lesions (vasculopathy) and tissue fibrosis. The disease has a high morbidity and mortality compared with other rheumatic diseases. This review discusses risk factors and markers that predict the disease course and the occurrence of disease manifestations, with an emphasis on major organ involvement. In addition, risk factors will be described that are associated with mortality in SSc patients. The review addresses the impact of recent developments on screening, diagnosis and risk stratification as well as the need for further research where data are lacking.
