Genetic, immune, hormonal, and environmental factors are associated with the multifactorial origin of autoimmunity. When one or more of these factors are altered, a "switch" from one autoimmune condition to another can occur, developing the so called "kaleidoscope phenomenon" of autoimmunity. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with myasthenia gravis and hypothyroidism probably resulting from autoimmune thyroiditis. A thymectomy was performed, and 1 year later, rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed based on clinical, radiological, and serological features. Nine years after thymectomy, systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed based on skin, renal, hematologic, and immunologic manifestations. We suggest that the immune system function was modified when thymectomy was performed, playing an important role in the development of the new autoimmune conditions. Thymectomy increases the risk of developing a new autoimmune disease because it modifies, by mechanisms not well defined, the equilibrium and normal function of the immune system. This patient presents the infrequent association of four autoimmune conditions. When a patient has one autoimmune disease, she is at risk for another.
