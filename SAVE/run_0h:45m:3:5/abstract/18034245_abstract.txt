The etiology of dermatomyositis is unknown, but immune mechanisms play an important role. Several dermatological manifestations have been reported among carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen, and after vaccination with the HBV vaccine. Almost all the skin reactions described were peculiar skin eruptions suggestive of an immune complex reaction. Some authors described the occurrence of dermatomyositis after BCG and influenza vaccination. We report a case of a 6-year-old child, who was vaccinated for hepatitis B virus and developed a flu-like disease accompanied by a skin rash, which had the typical features of dermatomyositis. The association of vaccination with autoimmunity is discussed.
