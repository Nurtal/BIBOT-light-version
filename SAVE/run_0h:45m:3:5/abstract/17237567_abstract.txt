In this case report we will describe a rare association between anhyrotic ectodermal dysplasia (AED) and immunodeficiency and autoimmunity [in our case: Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) and Crohn disease]. AED is a rare congenital disorder characterized by sparse hair, abnormal teeth and anhidrosis due to lack of eccrine glands. The survey of 87 cases with (AED) revealed only one Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD). AED has only two relevancies with immunodeficiency: (EDA-ID: Ectodermal Dysplasia Anhyrotic with Immunodeficiency) and APE-CED (Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, Candidiasis and Ectodermal Dysplasia) that in our case EDA-ID is strongly suspected.
