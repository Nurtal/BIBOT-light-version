Mutations in VPS33B and VIPAS39 cause the severe multisystem disorder Arthrogryposis, Renal dysfunction and Cholestasis (ARC) syndrome. Amongst other symptoms, patients with ARC syndrome suffer from severe ichthyosis. Roles for VPS33B and VIPAR have been reported in lysosome-related organelle biogenesis, integrin recycling, collagen homeostasis and maintenance of cell polarity. Mouse knockouts of Vps33b or Vipas39 are good models of ARC syndrome and develop an ichthyotic phenotype. We demonstrate that the skin manifestations in Vps33b and Vipar deficient mice are histologically similar to those of patients with ARC syndrome. Histological, immunofluorescent and electron microscopic analysis of Vps33b and Vipar deficient mouse skin biopsies and isolated primary cells showed that epidermal lamellar bodies, which are essential for skin barrier function, had abnormal morphology and the localisation of lamellar body cargo was disrupted. Stratum corneum formation was affected, with increased corneocyte thickness, decreased thickness of the cornified envelope and reduced deposition of lipids. These defects impact epidermal homeostasis and lead to abnormal barrier formation causing the skin phenotype in Vps33b and Vipar deficient mice and patients with ARC syndrome.
