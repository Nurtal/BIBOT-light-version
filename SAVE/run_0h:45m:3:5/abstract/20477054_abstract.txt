Development of lymphoproliferative diseases during the course of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions is well established. Conversely, development of clinical or biological signs of autoimmunity at the time of the diagnosis of lymphoma or during its course indicates that lymphoma and autoimmune manifestations may constitute two faces of the same process. The aim of this review is to describe autoimmune manifestations related to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, their specificity according to the lymphoma subtype and their physiopathological signification. Lymphoma-related autoimmune manifestations include mainly skin diseases, hematological manifestations, rheumatic diseases and renal lesions. Despite the lack of studies providing a systematic prospective assessment, autoimmune manifestations are observed in all lymphoma subtypes and seem particularly prevalent in marginal-zone lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. Autoimmune manifestation's physiopathology may implicate production of autoantibodies by CD5-positive autoreactive B cells, a loss of immune tolerance, an alteration of the Fas/Fas-ligand pathway and/or a chronic antigenic stimulation. Monoclonal antibodies (including rituximab, Campath-1H or epratuzumab) constitute the most promising approach to treat lymphoma-related immune disorders.
