We aim to estimate the incidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) among tetrazepam users and compare it with benzodiazepine users in a Spanish primary care database (BIFAP). The incidence in the general population (GenPop) and among phenytoin new users (as a positive control) was also estimated.
