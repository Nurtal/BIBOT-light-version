Cutaneous manifestations of malignancy are not uncommon, especially in advanced disease. They may also occur early in malignant disease or they may even signify recurrence particularly if they are paraneoplastic in nature. Clinical diagnosis can be difficult because of the wide spectrum of appearance of these lesions, and, in many cases, because of the lack of an identifiable underlying primary. Presented here is the case of a 65-year-old woman with multiple inflammatory cutaneous metastases, which were sclerodermoid in nature. These appeared 14 months after initial diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (ACUP) and signified the beginning of a rapid deterioration in her condition. The coexistence of limited systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and ACUP initially raised several interesting diagnostic possibilities. Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary and the sclerodermoid reaction in malignancy are discussed.
