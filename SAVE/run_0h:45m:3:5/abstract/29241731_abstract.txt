Omenn syndrome (OS) is a rare severe combined immunodeficiency associated with autoimmunity and caused by defects in lymphoid-specific V(D)J recombination. Most patients carry hypomorphic mutations in recombination-activating gene (RAG) 1 or 2. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the standard treatment; however, gene therapy (GT) might represent a valid alternative, especially for patients lacking a matched donor.
