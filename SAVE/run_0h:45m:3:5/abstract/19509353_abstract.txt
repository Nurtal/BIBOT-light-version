Appearance of autoantibodies and clinical manifestations of autoimmunity in melanoma patients treated with adjuvant interferon (IFN)-alpha2b was reported to be associated with improved prognosis. We assessed the association of the appearance of autoantibodies after initiation of treatment with recurrence-free interval in two randomized trials that compared intermediate doses of IFN with observation for the treatment of melanoma patients.
