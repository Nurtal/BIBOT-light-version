Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an essential treatment for many neurological, immunological and haematological conditions. However, the severity of its rare adverse effects is often underrecognised. We report a series of 15 patients receiving IVIg for neurological and immunological disorders who developed severe skin reactions. Despite pre-medication, nearly all patients ceased IVIg due to the severity of the adverse response. Interestingly, the majority of patients were male and two-thirds were receiving treatment for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) or another inflammatory or demyelinating neuropathy. This marked propensity for male patients with CIDP to develop significant dermatological reactions following IVIg administration has not previously been described. Mechanisms involving the underlying autoimmunity inherent to this condition may play a role.
