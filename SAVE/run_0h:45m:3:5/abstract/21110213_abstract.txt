The skin and nails are commonly involved in rheumatic conditions, both by the primary disease and/or long-term immunosuppressive treatments. These superficial affections may also imply a worsening of the quality of life in patients and cosmetic sequels. The latest advances in ultrasound technology show that skin and nail abnormalities are now recognizable and therefore susceptible to follow-up non-invasively. Thus, an ultrasound examination of these superficial tissues may be an adjunct tool for evaluating the progression and/or severity of rheumatic diseases in their primary or secondary manifestations.
