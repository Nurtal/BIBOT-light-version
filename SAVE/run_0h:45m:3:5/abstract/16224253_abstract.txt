Systemic sclerosis is characterized by fibrosis and autoimmunity. Systemic sclerosis displays a variety of abnormal immune activations, including the production of disease-specific autoantibodies, although the pathogenic relation between systemic autoimmunity and the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis remains unknown. Recent studies have rediscovered that B cells play critical roles in systemic autoimmunity and disease expression through various functions more than autoantibody production, such as antigen presentation and cytokine production. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding the B cell's role in systemic sclerosis.
