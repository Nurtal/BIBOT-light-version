Hypomorphic mutations that lead to "leaky" severe combined immunodeficiency presentation with partial protein function are increasingly being identified. Mutations in recombination-activating genes (RAGs) 1 and 2 cause immunodeficiency and dysregulation ranging from severe combined immunodeficiency to Omenn syndrome to more mild immunodeficiencies. We report here the cases of 3 patients with hypomorphic RAG1 mutations with distinct presentations. One patient had granulomatous skin disease and disseminated nontuberculous mycobacteria; the second patient presented with predominantly autoimmune manifestations; and the third patient presented with relatively late onset of infections and had isolated T-cell lymphopenia. These disparate and atypical presentations of hypomorphic RAG1 mutations highlight the role of RAG1 in immune function and autoimmunity and expand the disease spectrum linked to these genes.
