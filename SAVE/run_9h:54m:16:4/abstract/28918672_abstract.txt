Elucidation of the networks of physical (functional) interactions present in cells and tissues is fundamental for understanding the molecular organization of biological systems, the mechanistic basis of essential and disease-related processes, and for functional annotation of previously uncharacterized proteins (via guilt-by-association or -correlation). After a decade in the field, we felt it timely to document our own experiences in the systematic analysis of protein interaction networks. Areas covered: Researchers worldwide have contributed innovative experimental and computational approaches that have driven the rapidly evolving field of 'functional proteomics'. These include mass spectrometry-based methods to characterize macromolecular complexes on a global-scale and sophisticated data analysis tools - most notably machine learning - that allow for the generation of high-quality protein association maps. Expert commentary: Here, we recount some key lessons learned, with an emphasis on successful workflows, and challenges, arising from our own and other groups' ongoing efforts to generate, interpret and report proteome-scale interaction networks in increasingly diverse biological contexts.
