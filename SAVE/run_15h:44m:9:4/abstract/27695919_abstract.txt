The public accessibility of "big data" about the molecular targets of drugs and the biological functions of genes allows novel data science-based approaches to pharmacology that link drugs directly with their effects on pathophysiologic processes. This provides a phenotypic path to drug discovery and repurposing. This paper compares the performance of a functional genomics-based criterion to the traditional drug target-based classification.
