Quantum information technologies, on the one side, and intelligent learning&#13; systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a&#13; transforming impact on our society in the future.&#13; The respective underlying fields of basic research -- quantum information (QI) versus&#13; machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)&#13; -- have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been&#13; investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work,&#13; researchers have been probing the question to what extent these fields can indeed&#13; learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum&#13; computing and machine learning, investigating how results and techniques from one&#13; field can be used to solve the problems of the other. In recent time, we have&#13; witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance,&#13; quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for machine&#13; learning problems, critical in our ``big data'' world. Conversely, machine learning&#13; already permeates many cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in&#13; advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or&#13; classical machine learning optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum&#13; enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning&#13; tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally,&#13; works exploring the use of artificial intelligence for the very design of quantum&#13; experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have&#13; reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement -- exploring what&#13; ML/AI can do for quantum physics, and vice versa -- researchers have also broached&#13; the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This&#13; deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world&#13; that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main&#13; ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research&#13; investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.
