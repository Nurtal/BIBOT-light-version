When Leonard D'Avolio (Figure 1) was working on his Ph.D. degree in biomedical informatics, he saw the power of machine learning in transforming multiple industries; health care, however, was not among them.

If we could prove that is possible in health care too, I thought we would have the potential to have a huge impact," he says.
