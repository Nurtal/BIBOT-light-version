In microRNA (miRNA) target prediction, typically two levels of information need to be modeled: the number of potential miRNA binding sites present in a target mRNA and the genomic context of each individual site. Single model structures insufficiently cope with this complex training data structure, consisting of feature vectors of unequal length as a consequence of the varying number of miRNA binding sites in different mRNAs. To circumvent this problem, we developed a two-layered, stacked model, in which the influence of binding site context is separately modeled. Using logistic regression and random forests, we applied the stacked model approach to a unique data set of 7990 probed miRNA-mRNA interactions, hereby including the largest number of miRNAs in model training to date. Compared to lower-complexity models, a particular stacked model, named miSTAR (miRNA stacked model target prediction; www.mi-star.org), displays a higher general performance and precision on top scoring predictions. More importantly, our model outperforms published and widely used miRNA target prediction algorithms. Finally, we highlight flaws in cross-validation schemes for evaluation of miRNA target prediction models and adopt a more fair and stringent approach.
